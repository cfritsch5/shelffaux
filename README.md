## Shelfaux
The personal library visualization site

### Description
People are increasingly moving to digital books, however what we keep on our bookshelves says a lot about who we are and have been a longstanding aesthetic piece in many rooms. Shelffaux introduces a way to visually recreate the home library in poster form or for interactive digital display.

There are several library and book review and management sites, GoodReads being a primary example, however none of the available sites offer a visually appealing way to display your books, and they are no replacement for the interest that a bookshelf holds.

### MVP  

Shelffaux will enable users to

- [ ] Visually recreate a home library
- [ ] Browse through books on the shelf the same way one would physically. Books are displayed by spine, not frontcover, and as a user browses over them (mousing over, or swiping on touch screen) books are animated to allow the user to peak at the front and back covers.
- [ ] Optionally use their own photos for their books
- [ ] Sorting Algorithms to display books in different orders depending on user preference
